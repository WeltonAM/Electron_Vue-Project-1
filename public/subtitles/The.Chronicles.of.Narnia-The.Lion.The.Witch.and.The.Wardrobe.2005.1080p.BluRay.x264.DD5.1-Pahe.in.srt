1
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:40,643
Edmund! Get away from there!

2
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:43,813
Peter! What do you think you're doing?

3
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,773
Peter, quickly, the shelter. Now!

4
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:47,108
- Come on!
- Wait...

5
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,860
Come on, leave it!

6
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:51,988
Mummy!

7
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,534
Lucy, come on!

8
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:00,288
- Come on, quickly!
- Run!

9
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:02,123
Run!

10
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,084
- Hurry!
- Mum!

11
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:08,630
- Wait! Dad!
- Ed!

12
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:11,299
- Edmund, no!
- I'll get him!

13
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:14,719
- Peter, come back!
- Ed! Come here!

14
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,679
Edmund! Get down!

15
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,350
Come on, you idiot, run!

16
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:22,602
Get out!

17
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:29,400
Come on!

18
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:33,488
Hurry!

19
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,659
Why can't you think of anyone
but yourself? You're so selfish!

20
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:40,328
- You could've got us killed!
- Stop it!

21
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,330
It's okay.

22
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:50,880
Why can't you just do as you're told?

23
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:03,935
Alms for the poor. Alms for the poor.

24
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,353
God bless you, sir.

25
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,605
<i>Children and evacuation staff...</i>

26
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:10,692
You need to keep this on, darling.
All right?

27
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:14,028
You warm enough? Good girl.

28
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:18,408
Say hello to Auntie Laura.
Goodbye, darling, we love you.

29
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:22,203
- Dad wouldn't make us go.
- If Dad were here,

30
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,205
it'd mean the war was over.
We wouldn't have to.

31
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,709
You will listen to your brother,
won't you, Edmund?

32
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:44,726
Promise me you'll look after the others.

33
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,686
I will, Mum.

34
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:53,401
- Good man.
- All aboard! All aboard!

35
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:56,738
- Bye, darling!
- Bye!

36
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:58,114
Susan.

37
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:02,702
Be a big girl.

38
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:06,414
Hold on to your brother's hand.
Don't let it go.

39
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:11,043
All right. Off you go.

40
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:14,714
- All aboard!
- Bye-bye. Love you.

41
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,431
Hey, get off. I know how to get
on a train by myself.

42
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,141
Get off me!

43
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:29,812
May I have your tickets, please?
Tickets, please.

44
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:30,897
Peter.

45
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,984
- That's right. On you go.
- Yes. Thank you.

46
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:41,532
Come along.
Come along this way, please.

47
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:44,452
Come on, Lucy.
We have to stick together now.

48
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:47,914
Everything's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be fine.

49
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,875
Bye, Mummy! I love you!

50
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:09,393
- Bye-bye, dear.
- Bye! We'll miss you! See you soon.

51
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:12,021
- I love you, Mum! Bye!
- See you soon!

52
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,066
- Write to us, Mum!
- Love you!

53
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,461
Goosey Station. Goosey Station.

54
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:26,178
Give me your hand. Let's get going.

55
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,869
The professor knew we were coming.

56
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:35,373
Perhaps we've been
incorrectly labeled.

57
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,167
Come on, hup!

58
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,383
And whoa. Whoa.

59
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,517
- Mrs Macready?
- I'm afraid so.

60
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,939
Is this it, then?
Haven't you brought anything else?

61
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,482
No, ma'am.

62
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,193
It's just us.

63
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,321
Small favors.

64
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:13,285
Come on. Good girl.
Come on. Come on.

65
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:32,346
Professor Kirke is not accustomed
to havin' children in this house.

66
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,183
And, as such,
there are a few rules we need to follow.

67
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:39,562
There will be no shoutin'. Or runnin'.

68
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:42,690
No improper use of the dumbwaiter.

69
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,776
No touchin' of the historical artifacts!

70
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,698
And above all,

71
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:54,785
there shall be no disturbin'
of the professor.

72
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:09,550
<i>German aircraft carried out a number</i>
<i>of attacks on Great Britain last night.</i>

73
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,678
<i>The raids, which lasted</i>
<i>for several hours...</i>

74
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,643
The sheets feel scratchy.

75
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,982
Wars don't last forever, Lucy.
We'll be home soon.

76
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:29,236
- Yeah, if home's still there.
- Isn't it time you were in bed?

77
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,363
- Yes, Mum.
- Ed!

78
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:37,536
You saw outside. This place is huge.

79
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:40,414
We can do whatever we want here.

80
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:42,833
Tomorrow's going to be great.

81
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:45,169
Really.

82
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,510
Gastrovascular.

83
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,765
Come on, Peter. Gastrovascular.

84
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,769
- Is it Latin?
- Yes.

85
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,980
Is it Latin for
"worst game ever invented?"

86
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,860
We could play hide and seek.

87
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,281
But we're already having so much fun.

88
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,451
Come on, Peter, please.

89
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:19,912
Pretty please?

90
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:26,043
- One, two, three, four...
- What?

91
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:30,214
...five, six, seven, eight,

92
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,884
nine, ten, eleven...

93
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:49,233
...24, 25, 26...

94
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:06,584
I was here first!

95
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:13,859
...75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80,

96
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:18,489
81, 82, 83, 84,

97
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:23,077
85, 86, 87, 88,

98
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,581
89, 90, 91, 92,

99
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:30,709
93, 94, 95...

100
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,009
Were you hiding from me?

101
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:31,807
No.

102
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:33,934
Well...

103
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,146
I just... I...

104
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,731
No. No. I just...

105
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:42,693
I was just... I didn't want to scare you.

106
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:49,700
If you don't mind my asking...
What are you?

107
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,619
Well, I'm a... Well, I'm a faun.

108
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:54,830
And what about you?

109
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:58,083
You must be some kind of
beardless dwarf?

110
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:01,170
I'm not a dwarf! I'm a girl!

111
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,717
And, actually, I'm tallest in my class.

112
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,349
You mean to say that
you're a Daughter of Eve?

113
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,310
Well, my mum's name is Helen.

114
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:20,481
Yes, but you are in fact human.

115
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,400
Yes, of course.

116
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,779
What are you doing here?

117
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:31,366
Well, I was hiding in the wardrobe
in the spare room, and...

118
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,660
Spare Oom? Is that in Narnia?

119
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:36,246
Narnia? What's that?

120
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:39,833
Well, dear girl, you're in it.

121
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,211
Everything from the lamppost,

122
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:45,881
all the way to Castle Cair Paravel
on the Eastern Ocean,

123
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:51,803
every stick and stone you see,
every icicle is Narnia.

124
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,266
This is an awfully big wardrobe.

125
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,187
War Drobe? I'm sorry.

126
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,024
Please allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Tumnus.

127
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:07,611
Pleased to meet you, Mr Tumnus.
I'm Lucy Pevensie.

128
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:15,285
- Oh, you shake it.
- Why?

129
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,456
I... I don't know.

130
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,876
People do it
when they meet each other.

131
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:36,139
Well, then, Lucy Pevensie
from the shining city of War Drobe

132
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:39,351
in the wondrous land of Spare Oom,

133
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,813
how would it be if you came
and had tea with me?

134
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:46,525
Well, thank you very much, but I...

135
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,195
I probably should be getting back.

136
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:54,283
It's only just around the corner.
And there'll be a glorious fire

137
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:58,704
with toast and tea and cakes.

138
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,999
And, perhaps, we'll even
break into the sardines.

139
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,836
- I don't know.
- Come on.

140
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:10,173
It's not every day
that I get to make a new friend.

141
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:13,677
Well, I suppose I could come
for a little while.

142
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,972
If you have sardines.

143
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:19,600
By the bucketload.

144
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:32,988
You all right?

145
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,624
Well, here we are.

146
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,208
Come along.

147
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,717
- After you.
- May I help you with that?

148
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,719
Thank you very much.

149
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,739
Now, that... That is my father.

150
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,784
He has a nice face.

151
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,787
He looks a lot like you.

152
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:23,914
No.

153
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,793
No, I'm not very much
like him at all, really.

154
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,253
My father's fighting in the war.

155
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,217
My father went away to war too.

156
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,638
But that was a long, long time ago.

157
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:44,393
- Before this dreadful winter.
- Winter's not all bad.

158
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:48,230
There's ice skating and snowball fights.

159
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,983
- And Christmas!
- Not here.

160
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:57,447
No. No, we haven't had a Christmas
in a hundred years.

161
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:01,868
What?
No presents for a hundred years?

162
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:04,538
Always winter, never Christmas.

163
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,581
It's been a long winter.

164
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,961
But you would have
loved Narnia in summer.

165
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:15,382
We fauns danced
with the dryads all night,

166
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,635
and, you know, we never got tired.

167
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:23,473
And music. Oh, such music!

168
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:28,770
Would... Would you
like to hear some now?

169
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,941
Yes, please.

170
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:40,240
Now, are you familiar

171
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:43,952
- with any Narnian lullabies?
- Sorry, no.

172
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,163
Well, that's good.

173
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:51,543
Because this... Probably
won't sound anything like one.

174
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:19,422
- Oh, I should go.
- It's too late for that now.

175
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:23,093
I'm such a terrible faun.

176
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,014
Oh, no.

177
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,643
You're the nicest faun I've ever met.

178
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,855
Then I'm afraid you've had
a very poor sampling.

179
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:39,067
No. You can't have done
anything that bad.

180
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:45,282
It's not something I have done,
Lucy Pevensie.

181
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:48,910
It's something I am doing.

182
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:50,745
What are you doing?

183
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,373
I'm kidnapping you.

184
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,877
It was the White Witch.

185
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,131
She's the one who makes it always
winter, always cold. She gave orders.

186
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:04,092
If any of us ever find a human
wandering in the woods,

187
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,887
we're supposed to turn it over to her.

188
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:10,307
But, Mr Tumnus, you wouldn't.

189
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,064
I thought you were my friend.

190
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:26,239
Now. She may already know
you're here.

191
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:28,700
The woods are full of her spies.

192
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:34,456
Even some of the trees are on her side.

193
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:41,296
Can you find your way back from here?

194
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,506
- I think so.
- All right.

195
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:49,846
Will you be all right?

196
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:55,352
Hey, hey, hey.

197
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:58,355
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

198
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,026
Here.

199
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:08,365
Keep it. You need it more than I do.

200
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:15,080
No matter what happens,
Lucy Pevensie,

201
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:17,582
I am glad to have met you.

202
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:21,544
You've made me feel warmer
than I've felt in a hundred years.

203
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:23,964
Now go.

204
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:25,298
Go!

205
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,311
...99, 100.

206
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:39,771
Ready or not, here I come!

207
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:43,108
It's all right! I'm back! I'm all right!

208
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:45,235
Shut up! He's coming!

209
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:52,742
You know, I'm not sure you two
have quite got the idea of this game.

210
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,953
Weren't you wondering where I was?

211
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:58,623
That's the point.
That was why he was seeking you.

212
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:00,291
Does this mean I win?

213
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,960
I don't think Lucy
wants to play any more.

214
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:04,212
I've been gone for hours.

215
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:21,896
Lucy, the only wood in here
is the back of the wardrobe.

216
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,942
One game at a time, Lu.
We don't all have your imagination.

217
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:32,615
But I wasn't imagining!

218
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,410
That's enough, Lucy.

219
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,579
I wouldn't lie about this!

220
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,206
Well, I believe you.

221
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:43,043
- You do?
- Yeah, of course.

222
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:45,712
Didn't I tell you about
the field in the cupboards?

223
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:48,214
Will you just stop?

224
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,300
You just have to make
everything worse, don't you?

225
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:51,926
It was just a joke!

226
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,636
When are you gonna learn to grow up?

227
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,765
Shut up! You think you're Dad,
but you're not!

228
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,854
Well, that was nicely handled.

229
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:08,651
But... It really was there.

230
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:12,447
Susan's right, Lucy.

231
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,032
That's enough.

232
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,671
Lucy.

233
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,591
Where are you?

234
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,395
Lucy.

235
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,108
Hope you're not afraid of the dark.

236
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,324
Lucy?

237
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:26,789
Lucy?

238
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:29,834
Lucy!

239
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,146
Lucy.

240
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,358
Where are you?

241
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,402
Lucy.

242
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:00,031
I think I believe you now.

243
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:27,517
Lucy.

244
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:45,868
Lucy?

245
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:18,026
- Leave me alone!
- What is it now, Ginarrbrik?

246
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:20,611
Make him let me go!
I didn't do anything wrong!

247
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:22,905
How dare you address
the Queen of Narnia?

248
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:24,282
I didn't know!

249
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:27,410
- You will know her better hereafter!
- Wait!

250
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:40,840
What is your name, Son of Adam?

251
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:43,885
Edmund.

252
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,347
And how, Edmund,
did you come to enter my dominion?

253
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:51,976
I'm not sure.
I was just following my sister.

254
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,730
- Your sister? How many are you?
- Four.

255
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,941
Lucy's the only one
that's been here before.

256
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:02,362
She said she met some faun
called Tumnus.

257
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:05,823
Peter and Susan didn't believe her.
I didn't either.

258
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:10,328
Edmund, you look so cold.
Will you come and sit with me?

259
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:29,514
Now, how about
something hot to drink?

260
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:33,559
Yes, please, Your Majesty.

261
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:53,454
Your drink, sire.

262
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:56,249
How did you do that?

263
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:58,626
I can make anything you like.

264
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,379
Can you make me taller?

265
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:04,799
Anything you'd like to eat.

266
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:08,261
Turkish delight?

267
00:32:34,412 --> 00:32:35,663
Edmund?

268
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:39,667
I would very much like to meet
the rest of your family.

269
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,877
Why?

270
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:44,046
They're nothing special.

271
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:49,719
Oh, I'm sure they're not nearly
as delightful as you are.

272
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:54,974
But you see, Edmund,
I have no children of my own.

273
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:58,144
And you are exactly the sort of boy

274
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:02,732
who I could see, one day,
becoming Prince of Narnia.

275
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:05,359
Maybe even King.

276
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:08,404
Really?

277
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:12,742
Of course, you'd have
to bring your family.

278
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:17,246
Do you mean, Peter would be king too?

279
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,916
No! No, no.

280
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,793
But a king needs servants.

281
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:27,548
I guess I could bring 'em.

282
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:34,931
Beyond these woods,
you see those two hills?

283
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,391
My house is right between them.

284
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,144
You'd love it there, Edmund.

285
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:44,065
It has whole rooms
simply stuffed with Turkish delight.

286
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:47,985
- Couldn't I have some more now?
- No!

287
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:53,282
Don't want to ruin your appetite.

288
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:56,619
Besides, you and I are going to be
seeing each other again very soon.

289
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:59,163
I hope so, Your Majesty.

290
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:04,669
Until then, dear one.
I'm gonna miss you.

291
00:34:17,974 --> 00:34:19,267
Edmund?

292
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,521
Oh, Edmund! You got in too!

293
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:25,356
Isn't it wonderful?

294
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:30,027
- Where have you been?
- With Mr Tumnus. He's fine.

295
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,699
The White Witch hasn't found out
anything about him meeting me.

296
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:36,492
The White Witch?

297
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:40,788
She calls herself the Queen of Narnia,
but she really isn't.

298
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:45,501
Are you all right? You look awful.

299
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:48,838
Well, what'd you expect?
I mean, it's freezing.

300
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,550
- How do we get out of here?
- Come on.

301
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:54,844
This way.

302
00:34:57,638 --> 00:34:59,765
Peter, Peter, wake up! Peter, wake up!

303
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:01,851
It's there! It's really there!

304
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:04,312
- Lucy, what are you talking about?
- Narnia!

305
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:06,606
It's all in the wardrobe like I told you!

306
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:09,942
- You've just been dreaming, Lucy.
- But I haven't!

307
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:14,030
I saw Mr Tumnus again!
And this time Edmund went too.

308
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:19,827
You... You saw the faun?

309
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:26,667
Well, he didn't actually
go there with me.

310
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:29,670
He...

311
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:35,885
What were you doing, Edmund?

312
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:40,222
I was just playing along.

313
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:42,767
I'm sorry, Peter.

314
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,269
I shouldn't have encouraged her,

315
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:48,397
but you know what little children
are like these days.

316
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:52,109
They just don't know
when to stop pretending.

317
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,547
You children are one shenanigan
shy of sleepin' in the stable!

318
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:20,304
Professor. I'm sorry. I told them
you were not to be disturbed.

319
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:24,308
It's all right, Mrs Macready.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

320
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:28,771
But first of all, I think this one
is in need of a little hot chocolate.

321
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,564
Come along, dear.

322
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:43,703
You seem to have upset the delicate
internal balance of my housekeeper.

323
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:46,580
We're very sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

324
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:49,250
It's our sister, sir. Lucy.

325
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:52,211
- The weeping girl.
- Yes, sir.

326
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:55,256
- She's upset.
- Hence the weeping.

327
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:56,757
It's nothing.

328
00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:59,510
- We can handle it.
- Oh, I can see that.

329
00:37:01,846 --> 00:37:04,390
She thinks she's found a magical land.

330
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:06,517
In the upstairs wardrobe.

331
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:11,313
What did you say?

332
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:14,358
The wardrobe, upstairs.

333
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:18,112
Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside.

334
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:20,740
She won't stop going on about it.

335
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:24,702
- What was it like?
- Like talking to a lunatic.

336
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:27,246
No, no, no, not her. The forest.

337
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:30,666
- You're not saying you believe her?
- You don't?

338
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,334
But of course not.

339
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:34,920
I mean, logically, it's impossible.

340
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:37,882
What do they teach
in schools these days?

341
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:39,884
Edmund said
they were only pretending.

342
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:42,011
He's usually the more
truthful one, is he?

343
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:45,681
No. This would be the first time.

344
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:47,600
Well, if she's not mad
and she's not lying,

345
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:51,729
then logically we must
assume she's telling the truth.

346
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:56,400
You're saying that we
should just believe her?

347
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:01,405
She's your sister, isn't she?
You're her family.

348
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,744
You might just try acting like one.

349
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:11,665
Peter winds up,
poised to take yet another wicket!

350
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,754
Wake up, Dolly Daydream.

351
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:20,549
Why can't we play
hide and seek again?

352
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:22,968
I thought you said it was a kid's game.

353
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:26,889
Besides, we could all use the fresh air.

354
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:30,184
It's not like there isn't air inside.

355
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,229
- Are you ready?
- Are you?

356
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,624
- Well done, Ed.
- You bowled it!

357
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:56,293
- What on earth is goin' on?
- The Macready!

358
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:57,670
Come on!

359
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:08,013
No, no, back, back, back!

360
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:37,167
- Come on!
- You've got to be joking.

361
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:51,557
Get back!

362
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,976
- My toe!
- I'm not on your toe!

363
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,896
Move back. Will you stop shoving?

364
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,453
Impossible.

365
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,081
Don't worry.

366
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:18,709
I'm sure it's just your imagination.

367
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:22,755
I don't suppose saying we're sorry

368
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:26,133
- would quite cover it.
- No. It wouldn't.

369
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,304
But that might!

370
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,566
Stop it!

371
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,903
You little liar.

372
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:49,531
- You didn't believe her, either.
- Apologize to Lucy.

373
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:55,162
- Say you're sorry.
- All right! I'm sorry.

374
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:57,373
That's all right.

375
00:40:57,456 --> 00:41:00,501
Some children just don't know
when to stop pretending.

376
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:02,294
Oh, very funny.

377
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:04,004
Maybe we should go back.

378
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:07,257
But shouldn't we at least
take a look around?

379
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:09,468
I think Lucy should decide.

380
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:13,639
I'd like you all to meet Mr Tumnus!

381
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:16,392
Well, then Mr Tumnus it is.

382
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:20,980
But we can't go hiking
in the snow dressed like this.

383
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:22,231
No.

384
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:27,444
But I'm sure the professor
wouldn't mind us using these.

385
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:31,115
Anyway, if you think about it logically,

386
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:34,284
we're not even taking them
out of the wardrobe.

387
00:41:34,368 --> 00:41:36,996
- But that's a girl's coat!
- I know.

388
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:25,753
...lots and lots of lovely food,
and we'll have lots and lots of...

389
00:42:29,048 --> 00:42:30,174
Lu?

390
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:33,510
Lucy!

391
00:42:50,903 --> 00:42:53,322
Who would do something like this?

392
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,635
"The Faun Tumnus is hereby charged

393
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:19,098
"with High Treason
against Her Imperial Majesty,

394
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:22,267
"Jadis, Queen of Narnia,

395
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:25,479
"for comforting her enemies
and fraternizing with humans.

396
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:28,982
"Signed Maugrim,
Captain of the Secret Police.

397
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:31,985
"Long Live the Queen."

398
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:35,781
All right. Now we really should go back.

399
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:37,658
But what about Mr Tumnus?

400
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:40,619
If he was arrested just
for being with a human,

401
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:44,998
- I don't think there's much we can do.
- You don't understand, do you?

402
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,376
I'm the human.

403
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:50,629
She must have found out
he helped me.

404
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:54,049
- Maybe we could call the police.
- These are the police.

405
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:56,260
Don't worry, Lu.
We'll think of something.

406
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:57,719
Why?

407
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,722
I mean, he's a criminal.

408
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:08,480
Did that bird just "psst" us?

409
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:53,817
It... It's a beaver.

410
00:45:00,574 --> 00:45:01,950
Here, boy.

411
00:45:02,451 --> 00:45:03,869
Here, boy.

412
00:45:08,624 --> 00:45:11,960
I ain't gonna smell it,
if that's what you want.

413
00:45:13,337 --> 00:45:14,713
Sorry.

414
00:45:15,297 --> 00:45:16,798
Lucy Pevensie?

415
00:45:21,845 --> 00:45:23,096
Yes?

416
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:34,733
That's the hankie I gave to Mr Tum...

417
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:38,195
Tumnus. He got it to me
just before they took him.

418
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:39,988
Is he all right?

419
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:42,574
Further in.

420
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:47,579
- What are you doing?
- She's right.

421
00:45:47,663 --> 00:45:49,998
How do we know we can trust him?

422
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,501
He said he knows the faun.

423
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:55,921
He's a beaver.
He shouldn't be saying anything!

424
00:45:56,505 --> 00:45:57,881
Everything all right?

425
00:45:57,965 --> 00:46:00,259
Yes. We were just talking.

426
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:03,553
That's better left for safer quarters.

427
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,473
He means the trees.

428
00:46:21,363 --> 00:46:25,242
Come on. We don't want to be
caught out here after nightfall.

429
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:42,092
Blimey! Looks like the old girl
has got the kettle on.

430
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,177
Nice cup o' Rosy Lee.

431
00:46:44,261 --> 00:46:46,763
- It's lovely.
- It's merely a trifle.

432
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:49,141
Still plenty to do.
Ain't quite finished it yet.

433
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:52,185
It'll look the business
when it is, though.

434
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:56,148
Beaver, is that you?
I've been worried sick!

435
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:59,526
If I find you've been
out with Badger again, I...

436
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,447
Well, those aren't badgers.

437
00:47:03,572 --> 00:47:07,909
Oh, I never thought
I'd live to see this day.

438
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:12,331
Look at my fur. You couldn't
give me ten minutes warning?

439
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:16,001
I'd have given a week
if I thought it would've helped.

440
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:19,296
Oh, come inside, and we'll see
if we can't get you some food,

441
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:22,257
and some civilized company.

442
00:47:24,051 --> 00:47:26,178
Now, careful. Watch your step.

443
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:27,846
Excuse the mess.

444
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:30,974
Can't get Mr Beaver
to get out of his chair.

445
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,689
Enjoying the scenery, are we?

446
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,529
Isn't there anything
we can do to help Tumnus?

447
00:47:44,613 --> 00:47:47,449
They'll have taken him to the Witch's.
You know what they say.

448
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:51,370
There's few that go through
them gates that come out again.

449
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:53,288
Fish 'n' chips?

450
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:58,710
But there is hope, dear. Lots of hope.

451
00:47:58,794 --> 00:48:01,797
Oh, yeah,
there's a right bit more than hope!

452
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:05,133
Aslan is on the move.

453
00:48:12,766 --> 00:48:14,184
Who's Aslan?

454
00:48:15,102 --> 00:48:16,520
Who's Aslan?

455
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:19,272
You cheeky little blighter.

456
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:22,901
What?

457
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:28,907
- You don't know, do you?
- We haven't exactly been here long.

458
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,743
Well, he's only the king
of the whole wood.

459
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:35,497
The top geezer.
The real King of Narnia.

460
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:39,209
- He's been away for a long while.
- But he's just got back!

461
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:41,586
And he's waiting for you
near the Stone Table!

462
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:45,006
- He's waiting for us?
- You're blooming joking!

463
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:47,676
They don't even know
about the prophecy!

464
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:50,512
- Well, then...
- Look.

465
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:53,932
Aslan's return,

466
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:57,352
Tumnus' arrest, the secret police,

467
00:48:57,436 --> 00:48:59,438
it's all happening because of you!

468
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:02,941
- You're blaming us?
- No! Not blaming.

469
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:06,194
- Thanking you.
- There's a prophecy.

470
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,865
"When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone

471
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:12,993
"sits at Cair Paravel in throne,

472
00:49:13,076 --> 00:49:15,537
"the evil time will be over and done."

473
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,123
- That doesn't really rhyme.
- I know it don't.

474
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:20,667
You're kind of missing the point!

475
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,003
It has long been foretold

476
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:26,131
that two Sons of Adam
and two Daughters of Eve

477
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:30,719
will defeat the White Witch
and restore peace to Narnia.

478
00:49:33,555 --> 00:49:35,056
And you think we're the ones?

479
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,976
You'd better be, 'cause Aslan's
already fitted out your army.

480
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,562
- Our army?
- Mum sent us away

481
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:43,356
so we wouldn't get caught up in a war.

482
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:46,693
I think you've made a mistake.

483
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:49,696
- We're not heroes.
- We're from Finchley.

484
00:49:51,907 --> 00:49:54,242
Thank you for your hospitality.

485
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:59,623
- But we really have to go.
- No, you can't just leave!

486
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:03,335
He's right.
We have to help Mr Tumnus.

487
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:05,295
It's out of our hands.

488
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:07,464
I'm sorry,

489
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:10,926
but it's time the four of us
were getting home. Ed?

490
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:14,429
Ed?

491
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:19,893
- I'm gonna kill him.
- You may not have to.

492
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:23,146
Has Edmund ever been
to Narnia before?

493
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:51,466
Hurry!

494
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:14,489
- Edmund!
- They'll hear you!

495
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:16,992
No!

496
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:19,494
- Get off!
- You're playing into her hands.

497
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:21,454
- We can't just let him go!
- He's our brother!

498
00:51:21,538 --> 00:51:23,248
He's the bait!

499
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:25,584
- The Witch wants all four of you!
- Why?

500
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:28,837
To stop the prophecy from coming true.

501
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,589
To kill you!

502
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:43,435
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

503
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:46,646
None of this would have happened
if you had listened to me!

504
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:49,482
- You knew this would happen.
- I didn't know.

505
00:51:49,566 --> 00:51:51,651
Which is why we should
have left while we could!

506
00:51:51,735 --> 00:51:53,028
Stop it!

507
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:57,240
- This isn't going to help Edmund.
- She's right.

508
00:51:58,283 --> 00:52:01,036
Only Aslan can help your brother now.

509
00:52:02,954 --> 00:52:04,873
Then take us to him.

510
00:53:14,693 --> 00:53:17,821
Be still, stranger,
or you'll never move again.

511
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:19,989
- Who are you?
- I'm Edmund!

512
00:53:20,073 --> 00:53:23,368
I met the Queen in the woods!
She told me to come back here!

513
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:25,161
I'm a Son of Adam!

514
00:53:25,954 --> 00:53:29,624
My apologies,
fortunate favorite of the queen.

515
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:33,044
Or else, not so fortunate.

516
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:39,718
Right this way.

517
00:54:00,989 --> 00:54:02,323
Wait here.

518
00:54:41,905 --> 00:54:43,198
Like it?

519
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:47,535
Yes, Your Majesty.

520
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,540
I thought you might.

521
00:54:54,876 --> 00:54:56,544
Tell me, Edmund...

522
00:54:59,214 --> 00:55:01,466
Are your sisters deaf?

523
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:02,967
No.

524
00:55:03,051 --> 00:55:05,261
And your brother, is he

525
00:55:08,056 --> 00:55:09,724
unintelligent?

526
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,310
Well, I think so. But Mum says...

527
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:16,314
Then how dare you come alone!

528
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:19,108
- I tried!
- Edmund, I asked so little of you.

529
00:55:19,192 --> 00:55:22,070
- They just don't listen to me!
- You couldn't even do that.

530
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:24,030
I did bring them halfway.

531
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:27,742
They're at the little house
at the dam with the Beavers.

532
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:34,999
Well.

533
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:39,003
I suppose you're not
a total loss then, are you?

534
00:55:42,257 --> 00:55:44,175
Well, I was wondering,

535
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:49,848
could I maybe have some more
Turkish delight now?

536
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,647
Our guest is hungry.

537
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:08,074
This way for your num-nums.

538
00:56:10,285 --> 00:56:11,619
Maugrim?

539
00:56:15,248 --> 00:56:17,125
You know what to do.

540
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:45,820
Hurry, Mother! They're after us!

541
00:56:45,904 --> 00:56:48,865
- Oh, right then.
- What's she doing?

542
00:56:49,657 --> 00:56:51,409
Oh, you'll be thanking me later.

543
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:54,829
It's a long journey and Beaver
gets pretty cranky when he's hungry.

544
00:56:54,913 --> 00:56:56,456
I'm cranky now!

545
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:00,376
Take them.

546
00:57:03,588 --> 00:57:07,508
- Do you think we'll need jam?
- Only if the Witch serves toast.

547
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:23,858
Hurry.

548
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:41,793
Badger and me dug this.
Comes out right near his place.

549
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:44,128
You told me it led to your mum's!

550
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:46,297
Lucy!

551
00:57:48,174 --> 00:57:49,300
They're in the tunnel.

552
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:51,511
- Quick! This way.
- Hurry!

553
00:57:53,888 --> 00:57:56,099
- Run!
- Quick! Quick! Quick!

554
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,150
You should have brought a map!

555
00:58:06,234 --> 00:58:08,778
There wasn't room next to the jam.

556
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,912
Come on, Lucy!

557
00:58:37,974 --> 00:58:39,934
I'm so sorry, dear.

558
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:43,187
He was my best mate.

559
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:54,240
What happened here?

560
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:56,868
This is what becomes
of those who cross the Witch.

561
00:58:56,951 --> 00:59:00,496
You take one more step, traitor,
and I'll chew you to splinters!

562
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:03,750
Relax. I'm one of the good guys.

563
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:07,837
Yeah? Well, you look an awful lot
like one of the bad ones.

564
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,298
An unfortunate family resemblance.

565
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:14,260
But we can argue breeding later.
Right now we've got to move.

566
00:59:15,053 --> 00:59:17,138
What did you have in mind?

567
00:59:24,729 --> 00:59:26,397
Greetings, gents.

568
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:30,193
- Lost something, have we?
- Don't patronize me!

569
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:33,237
I know where your allegiance lies.

570
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:35,656
We're looking for some humans.

571
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:38,743
Humans? Here in Narnia?

572
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,622
That's a valuable bit of information,
don't you think?

573
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:45,750
Your reward is your life.

574
00:59:46,334 --> 00:59:47,960
It's not much,

575
00:59:49,462 --> 00:59:50,922
but still.

576
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:53,508
Where are the fugitives?

577
01:00:00,515 --> 01:00:03,226
North. They ran north.

578
01:00:04,477 --> 01:00:06,020
Smell them out.

579
01:00:17,073 --> 01:00:20,785
They were helping Tumnus.
The Witch got here before I did.

580
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:24,580
Are you all right?

581
01:00:24,664 --> 01:00:27,959
Well, I wish I could say their bark
was worse than their bite.

582
01:00:28,042 --> 01:00:31,879
Stop squirming!
You're worse than Beaver on bath day.

583
01:00:32,547 --> 01:00:34,215
Worst day of the year.

584
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:36,759
Thank you for your kindness,

585
01:00:36,843 --> 01:00:38,636
but that's all the cure I have time for.

586
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:39,762
You're leaving?

587
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:43,599
It has been a pleasure, My Queen,
and an honor, but time is short

588
01:00:43,683 --> 01:00:46,686
and Aslan himself has asked me
to gather more troops.

589
01:00:46,769 --> 01:00:49,814
- You've seen Aslan?
- What's he like?

590
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:53,526
Like everything we've ever heard.

591
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:57,572
You'll be glad to have him by your side
in the battle against the Witch.

592
01:00:57,655 --> 01:00:59,699
But we're not planning
on fighting any witch.

593
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:02,410
But surely, King Peter, the prophecy!

594
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:05,872
We can't go to war without you.

595
01:01:11,002 --> 01:01:13,296
We just want our brother back.

596
01:01:38,112 --> 01:01:39,280
If...

597
01:01:41,324 --> 01:01:43,826
If you're not going to eat that...

598
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,584
I'd get up, but...

599
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:54,337
...but my legs.

600
01:02:04,472 --> 01:02:07,016
Mr Tumnus.

601
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:10,645
What's left of him.

602
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,529
- You're Lucy Pevensie's brother.
- I'm Edmund.

603
01:02:22,615 --> 01:02:25,076
Yes. Yes, you have the same nose.

604
01:02:30,206 --> 01:02:32,375
Is your sister all right?

605
01:02:34,335 --> 01:02:36,003
Is she safe?

606
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:41,842
I don't know.

607
01:02:48,891 --> 01:02:52,353
My police tore that dam apart.

608
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:56,691
Your little family
are nowhere to be found.

609
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:03,781
- Where did they go?
- I don't know!

610
01:03:04,657 --> 01:03:07,535
Then you're of no further use to me.

611
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:11,622
Wait! The beaver
said something about Aslan!

612
01:03:16,252 --> 01:03:17,545
Aslan?

613
01:03:18,796 --> 01:03:20,047
Where?

614
01:03:23,384 --> 01:03:25,886
- I...
- He's a stranger here, Your Majesty.

615
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:28,639
He can't be expected to know anything.

616
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:33,060
I said, where is Aslan?

617
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:39,942
I... I don't know.

618
01:03:40,401 --> 01:03:42,820
I left before they said anything.

619
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:46,907
I wanted to see you!

620
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:50,911
Guard!

621
01:03:52,038 --> 01:03:53,581
Your Majesty.

622
01:03:55,624 --> 01:03:57,418
Release the faun.

623
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:14,018
Do you know why you're here, faun?

624
01:04:15,061 --> 01:04:18,981
Because I believe in a free Narnia.

625
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:22,693
You're here

626
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:26,572
because he turned you in.

627
01:04:28,616 --> 01:04:30,117
For sweeties.

628
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:39,835
Take him upstairs.

629
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:47,093
And ready my sleigh.

630
01:04:48,052 --> 01:04:50,221
Edmund misses his family.

631
01:05:13,411 --> 01:05:17,081
Now, Aslan's camp
is near the Stone Table

632
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:20,167
- just across the frozen river.
- River?

633
01:05:20,251 --> 01:05:23,671
The river's been frozen solid
for a hundred years.

634
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:31,011
- It's so far.
- It's the world, dear.

635
01:05:31,095 --> 01:05:33,389
Did you expect it to be small?

636
01:05:33,931 --> 01:05:35,266
Smaller.

637
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,536
When you're ready, Son of Adam.

638
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:34,074
Come on, humans!
While we're still young.

639
01:06:35,701 --> 01:06:38,537
If he tells us to hurry one more time,

640
01:06:38,621 --> 01:06:41,749
I'm gonna turn him into a big, fluffy hat.

641
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,543
Hurry up! Come on!

642
01:06:44,627 --> 01:06:48,047
- He is getting a little bossy.
- No! Behind you! It's her!

643
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:50,257
- Run! Run!
- Run!

644
01:07:15,616 --> 01:07:16,909
Hurry!

645
01:07:19,954 --> 01:07:21,497
Inside!

646
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,123
Dive! Dive!

647
01:07:26,085 --> 01:07:28,254
Quick! Quick, quick, quick!

648
01:07:56,574 --> 01:07:58,867
Maybe she's gone.

649
01:08:00,035 --> 01:08:02,121
- I suppose I'll go look.
- No!

650
01:08:02,204 --> 01:08:04,790
You're worth nothing to Narnia dead.

651
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:07,126
Well, neither are you, Beaver.

652
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:09,003
Thanks, sweetheart.

653
01:08:17,845 --> 01:08:19,763
What's that? What's...

654
01:08:24,393 --> 01:08:25,894
Come out! Come out!

655
01:08:25,978 --> 01:08:27,021
I hope you've all been good

656
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:29,773
'cause there's someone here
to see you!

657
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:53,130
Merry Christmas, sir.

658
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:57,009
It certainly is, Lucy,
since you have arrived.

659
01:08:57,551 --> 01:09:01,305
Look, I've put up with a lot
since I got here, but this...

660
01:09:01,388 --> 01:09:04,725
- We thought you were the Witch.
- Yes, yes, I'm sorry about that,

661
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:10,689
but in my defense, I have been driving
one of these longer than the Witch.

662
01:09:10,773 --> 01:09:13,484
I thought there was
no Christmas in Narnia.

663
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:16,153
No. Not for a long time.

664
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:20,532
But the hope that you have brought,
Your Majesties,

665
01:09:20,616 --> 01:09:23,744
is finally starting
to weaken the Witch's power.

666
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:28,457
Still, I dare say
you could do with these.

667
01:09:32,503 --> 01:09:33,921
Presents!

668
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,680
The juice of the fire-flower.

669
01:09:42,763 --> 01:09:45,641
One drop will cure any injury.

670
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:51,397
And though I hope
you never have to use it.

671
01:09:54,066 --> 01:09:55,359
Thank you, sir,

672
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:58,904
but I think I could be brave enough.

673
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:01,407
I'm sure you could.

674
01:10:02,116 --> 01:10:05,035
But battles are ugly affairs.

675
01:10:12,459 --> 01:10:13,711
Susan.

676
01:10:16,463 --> 01:10:20,426
Trust in this bow
and it will not easily miss.

677
01:10:22,511 --> 01:10:25,514
What happened
to "battles are ugly affairs"?

678
01:10:27,516 --> 01:10:30,686
Though you don't seem to have
a problem making yourself heard,

679
01:10:30,769 --> 01:10:33,647
blow on this and wherever you are,

680
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,817
help will come.

681
01:10:37,985 --> 01:10:39,319
Thanks.

682
01:10:40,279 --> 01:10:41,530
Peter.

683
01:10:43,615 --> 01:10:46,744
The time to use these
may be near at hand.

684
01:10:55,043 --> 01:10:56,670
Thank you, sir.

685
01:10:57,004 --> 01:11:00,257
These are tools, not toys.

686
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:03,218
Bear them well and wisely.

687
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:07,765
Now, I must be off.

688
01:11:07,848 --> 01:11:10,267
Winter is almost over,

689
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:14,563
and things do pile up when
you've been gone a hundred years.

690
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:20,319
Long live Aslan!

691
01:11:22,696 --> 01:11:24,490
And Merry Christmas!

692
01:11:27,201 --> 01:11:29,787
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

693
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:32,372
- See you next year!
- Goodbye!

694
01:11:33,707 --> 01:11:35,793
Told you he was real.

695
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:39,630
He said winter was almost over.

696
01:11:40,839 --> 01:11:42,883
You know what that means.

697
01:11:44,218 --> 01:11:45,719
No more ice.

698
01:11:56,814 --> 01:11:59,650
- We need to cross, now!
- Don't beavers make dams?

699
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:02,361
- I'm not that fast, dear.
- Come on!

700
01:12:02,444 --> 01:12:04,404
Wait! Will you think
about this for a minute?

701
01:12:04,488 --> 01:12:07,366
- We don't have a minute.
- I'm just trying to be realistic.

702
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:10,994
No, you're trying to be smart. As usual.

703
01:12:45,654 --> 01:12:47,948
Wait. Maybe I should go first.

704
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:50,492
Maybe you should.

705
01:12:57,374 --> 01:12:59,877
You've been sneaking
second helpings, haven't you?

706
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,588
Well, you never know
which meal's gonna be your last.

707
01:13:02,671 --> 01:13:05,007
Especially with your cooking.

708
01:13:24,443 --> 01:13:26,069
If Mum knew what we were doing...

709
01:13:26,153 --> 01:13:27,821
Mum's not here.

710
01:13:29,615 --> 01:13:30,991
Oh, no!

711
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,327
Run!

712
01:13:36,788 --> 01:13:37,998
Hurry!

713
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:51,011
- No!
- Peter!

714
01:13:52,137 --> 01:13:53,889
Put that down, boy.

715
01:13:54,723 --> 01:13:57,726
- Someone could get hurt.
- Don't worry about me!

716
01:13:57,809 --> 01:13:59,186
Run him through!

717
01:13:59,269 --> 01:14:03,315
Leave now while you can,
and your brother leaves with you.

718
01:14:03,398 --> 01:14:06,610
Stop, Peter!
Maybe we should listen to him!

719
01:14:06,693 --> 01:14:07,736
Smart girl.

720
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:11,281
Don't listen to him!
Kill him! Kill him now!

721
01:14:11,365 --> 01:14:14,660
Oh, come on. This isn't your war.

722
01:14:14,743 --> 01:14:18,121
All my Queen wants is for you
to take your family and go.

723
01:14:18,205 --> 01:14:21,041
Look, just because some man
in a red coat hands you a sword,

724
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:24,628
it doesn't make you a hero! Just drop it!

725
01:14:24,711 --> 01:14:27,255
No, Peter! Narnia needs you!

726
01:14:27,339 --> 01:14:29,466
Gut him while you still have a chance!

727
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:33,303
What's it gonna be, Son of Adam?
I won't wait forever.

728
01:14:33,887 --> 01:14:36,056
And neither will the river.

729
01:14:37,557 --> 01:14:38,767
Peter!

730
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:47,651
Hold onto me!

731
01:15:49,296 --> 01:15:50,547
Lovely.

732
01:15:58,722 --> 01:16:00,474
What have you done?

733
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:04,478
Lucy!

734
01:16:06,605 --> 01:16:07,939
Lucy!

735
01:16:12,903 --> 01:16:14,988
Has anyone seen my coat?

736
01:16:21,495 --> 01:16:23,455
Don't you worry, dear.

737
01:16:23,538 --> 01:16:26,875
Your brother's got you
well looked after.

738
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:30,670
And I don't think you'll be
needing those coats any more.

739
01:17:05,956 --> 01:17:08,333
It's so warm out.

740
01:17:12,254 --> 01:17:14,506
I'll go and check the sleigh.

741
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:18,385
Your Majesty.

742
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:20,345
We found the traitor.

743
01:17:20,428 --> 01:17:24,015
He was rallying your enemies
near the Shuddering Woods.

744
01:17:24,641 --> 01:17:26,268
Nice of you to drop in.

745
01:17:26,351 --> 01:17:29,187
You were so helpful
to my wolves last night.

746
01:17:29,271 --> 01:17:31,565
Perhaps you can help me now.

747
01:17:32,149 --> 01:17:35,569
- Forgive me, Your Majesty.
- Oh, don't waste time with flattery.

748
01:17:35,652 --> 01:17:39,573
Not to seem rude,
but I wasn't actually talking to you.

749
01:17:48,832 --> 01:17:51,168
Where are the humans headed?

750
01:17:55,255 --> 01:17:59,759
Wait! No! Don't. The beaver said
something about the Stone Table,

751
01:17:59,843 --> 01:18:02,429
and that Aslan had an army there.

752
01:18:03,346 --> 01:18:04,806
An army?

753
01:18:10,896 --> 01:18:12,856
Thank you, Edmund.

754
01:18:12,939 --> 01:18:16,443
I'm glad this creature
got to see some honesty

755
01:18:17,819 --> 01:18:20,572
- before he dies.
- No!

756
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:34,044
Think about whose side you're on,
Edmund.

757
01:18:34,836 --> 01:18:36,296
Mine

758
01:18:38,673 --> 01:18:40,175
or theirs.

759
01:18:46,473 --> 01:18:48,934
Go on ahead. Gather the faithful.

760
01:18:49,851 --> 01:18:52,062
If it's a war Aslan wants,

761
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:56,524
it's a war he shall get.

762
01:19:58,044 --> 01:20:00,755
Why are they all staring at us?

763
01:20:00,839 --> 01:20:03,258
Maybe they think you look funny.

764
01:20:08,388 --> 01:20:11,057
Stop your fussing. You look lovely.

765
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,287
We have come to see Aslan.

766
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:19,584
Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam.

767
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:23,046
Welcome, Susan and Lucy,
Daughters of Eve.

768
01:21:23,797 --> 01:21:27,342
And welcome to you, Beavers.
You have my thanks.

769
01:21:27,425 --> 01:21:29,469
But where is the fourth?

770
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:33,348
That's why we're here, sir.

771
01:21:33,973 --> 01:21:35,558
We need your help.

772
01:21:35,642 --> 01:21:38,353
We had a little trouble along the way.

773
01:21:39,145 --> 01:21:41,064
Our brother's been captured
by the White Witch.

774
01:21:41,147 --> 01:21:44,025
Captured? How could this happen?

775
01:21:45,652 --> 01:21:48,863
He betrayed them, Your Majesty.

776
01:21:50,073 --> 01:21:53,034
- Then he has betrayed us all!
- Peace, Oreius.

777
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:56,413
I'm sure there's an explanation.

778
01:21:58,873 --> 01:22:00,792
It's my fault, really.

779
01:22:02,502 --> 01:22:04,462
I was too hard on him.

780
01:22:08,675 --> 01:22:10,093
We all were.

781
01:22:10,969 --> 01:22:12,846
Sir, he's our brother.

782
01:22:12,929 --> 01:22:14,639
I know, dear one.

783
01:22:14,973 --> 01:22:18,143
But that only makes
the betrayal all the worse.

784
01:22:18,852 --> 01:22:21,396
This may be harder than you think.

785
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:33,199
That is Cair Paravel,
the castle of the four thrones.

786
01:22:34,659 --> 01:22:38,121
In one of which you will sit, Peter,
as High King.

787
01:22:39,831 --> 01:22:41,958
You doubt the prophecy?

788
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:44,878
No. That's just it.

789
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:49,674
Aslan, I'm not what you all think I am.

790
01:22:49,757 --> 01:22:52,510
Peter Pevensie, formerly of Finchley.

791
01:22:53,887 --> 01:22:58,057
Beaver also mentioned that you
planned on turning him into a hat.

792
01:23:01,311 --> 01:23:06,357
Peter, there is a Deep Magic,
more powerful than any of us,

793
01:23:06,441 --> 01:23:08,860
that rules over all of Narnia.

794
01:23:08,943 --> 01:23:11,446
It defines right from wrong,

795
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:13,990
and governs all our destinies.

796
01:23:14,073 --> 01:23:16,910
Yours... And mine.

797
01:23:17,702 --> 01:23:19,412
But I couldn't even
protect my own family.

798
01:23:19,496 --> 01:23:22,081
You've brought them safely this far.

799
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:24,709
Not all of them.

800
01:23:24,792 --> 01:23:28,463
Peter, I will do what I can
to help your brother,

801
01:23:29,172 --> 01:23:32,175
but I need you to consider
what I ask of you.

802
01:23:34,219 --> 01:23:36,721
I, too, want my family safe.

803
01:23:39,766 --> 01:23:42,977
Is our little prince uncomfortable?

804
01:23:43,728 --> 01:23:46,397
Does he want his pillow fluffed?

805
01:23:49,275 --> 01:23:52,779
Special treatment for the special boy!

806
01:23:54,864 --> 01:23:57,158
Isn't that what you wanted?

807
01:23:59,953 --> 01:24:01,788
You look like Mum.

808
01:24:01,871 --> 01:24:05,375
Mum hasn't had a dress like this
since before the war.

809
01:24:06,084 --> 01:24:09,712
We should bring her one back.
A whole trunk full!

810
01:24:11,631 --> 01:24:13,424
If we ever get back.

811
01:24:17,387 --> 01:24:19,472
I'm sorry I'm like that.

812
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:23,893
We used to have fun together,
didn't we?

813
01:24:24,394 --> 01:24:27,814
Yes. Before you got boring.

814
01:24:28,856 --> 01:24:30,316
Oh, really?

815
01:24:43,788 --> 01:24:45,582
Please don't try to run.

816
01:24:45,665 --> 01:24:49,168
- We're tired.
- And we prefer to kill you quickly.

817
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:55,592
Susan!

818
01:25:05,184 --> 01:25:06,561
Get back!

819
01:25:07,312 --> 01:25:08,563
Peter!

820
01:25:11,316 --> 01:25:12,692
Come on.

821
01:25:13,693 --> 01:25:16,446
We've already been
through this before.

822
01:25:16,529 --> 01:25:19,073
We both know you haven't got it in you.

823
01:25:19,157 --> 01:25:21,034
Peter! Watch out!

824
01:25:30,126 --> 01:25:34,255
No! Stay your weapons.
This is Peter's battle.

825
01:25:36,257 --> 01:25:38,468
You may think you're a king,

826
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:40,803
but you're going to die

827
01:25:40,887 --> 01:25:42,972
- like a dog!
- Look out!

828
01:25:43,431 --> 01:25:44,849
Peter!

829
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:04,243
After him.

830
01:26:05,244 --> 01:26:07,288
He'll lead you to Edmund.

831
01:26:12,126 --> 01:26:13,378
Peter.

832
01:26:13,961 --> 01:26:15,755
Clean your sword.

833
01:26:20,343 --> 01:26:24,138
Rise, Sir Peter Wolf's-Bane,

834
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:27,308
Knight of Narnia.

835
01:26:53,793 --> 01:26:55,545
The minotaurs will take the left flanks.

836
01:26:55,628 --> 01:26:58,631
We'll keep the giants in reserve
and send dwarfs in first.

837
01:27:07,932 --> 01:27:09,434
The prisoner!

838
01:27:38,504 --> 01:27:40,631
You're not going to kill me?

839
01:27:43,801 --> 01:27:45,094
Not yet.

840
01:27:49,015 --> 01:27:50,808
We have work to do.

841
01:28:22,548 --> 01:28:23,883
Edmund!

842
01:28:56,165 --> 01:28:58,417
What's done is done.

843
01:28:58,501 --> 01:29:02,088
There is no need to speak to Edmund
about what is past.

844
01:29:11,389 --> 01:29:12,598
Hello.

845
01:29:26,946 --> 01:29:29,699
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little tired.

846
01:29:30,616 --> 01:29:32,326
Get some sleep.

847
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:41,961
And Edmund,

848
01:29:44,755 --> 01:29:46,799
try not to wander off.

849
01:29:59,854 --> 01:30:02,815
Narnia's not going
to run out of toast, Ed.

850
01:30:03,983 --> 01:30:07,069
I'm sure they'll pack something up
for the journey back.

851
01:30:07,153 --> 01:30:08,654
We're going home?

852
01:30:09,697 --> 01:30:10,948
You are.

853
01:30:12,533 --> 01:30:15,244
I promised Mum
I'd keep you three safe.

854
01:30:15,912 --> 01:30:18,414
But it doesn't mean
I can't stay behind and help.

855
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:20,207
But they need us.

856
01:30:22,168 --> 01:30:24,253
All four of us.

857
01:30:24,337 --> 01:30:26,213
Lucy, it's too dangerous.

858
01:30:26,297 --> 01:30:29,508
You almost drowned!
Edmund was almost killed!

859
01:30:29,592 --> 01:30:31,844
Which is why we have to stay.

860
01:30:34,388 --> 01:30:38,684
I've seen what the White Witch can do.
And I've helped her do it.

861
01:30:40,353 --> 01:30:43,898
And we can't leave these
people behind to suffer for it.

862
01:30:51,322 --> 01:30:53,491
I suppose that's it then.

863
01:30:55,242 --> 01:30:57,119
Where are you going?

864
01:30:58,537 --> 01:31:00,665
To get in some practice.

865
01:31:24,063 --> 01:31:27,233
Come on, Ed! Sword point up,
like Oreius showed us.

866
01:31:27,316 --> 01:31:29,360
<i>- En garde!</i>
- Now block.

867
01:31:30,903 --> 01:31:33,406
- Hey!
- Peter! Edmund!

868
01:31:34,824 --> 01:31:36,409
Whoa, horsie!

869
01:31:37,368 --> 01:31:39,120
My name is Philip.

870
01:31:40,246 --> 01:31:41,664
Sorry.

871
01:31:41,747 --> 01:31:44,750
The Witch has demanded
a meeting with Aslan.

872
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:47,628
She's on her way here.

873
01:31:48,087 --> 01:31:51,841
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

874
01:31:51,924 --> 01:31:56,178
- Go away, Witch!
- Empress of the Lone Islands!

875
01:31:56,721 --> 01:31:59,557
You don't belong here! Go away!

876
01:32:23,622 --> 01:32:26,542
You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.

877
01:32:29,503 --> 01:32:32,089
His offense was not against you.

878
01:32:33,007 --> 01:32:35,885
Have you forgotten the laws
upon which Narnia was built?

879
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:39,221
Do not cite
the Deep Magic to me, Witch.

880
01:32:39,805 --> 01:32:42,141
I was there when it was written.

881
01:32:43,976 --> 01:32:47,980
Then you'll remember well
that every traitor belongs to me.

882
01:32:49,607 --> 01:32:51,650
His blood is my property.

883
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:54,278
Try and take him then.

884
01:32:57,615 --> 01:33:01,410
Do you really think that mere force
will deny me my right,

885
01:33:02,828 --> 01:33:04,413
little King?

886
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:11,087
Aslan knows that unless I have blood,
as the law demands,

887
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:14,006
all of Narnia will be overturned

888
01:33:14,507 --> 01:33:17,760
and perish in fire and water.

889
01:33:17,843 --> 01:33:20,179
That boy will die

890
01:33:20,763 --> 01:33:22,640
on the Stone Table,

891
01:33:26,393 --> 01:33:28,229
as is tradition.

892
01:33:31,065 --> 01:33:32,983
You dare not refuse me.

893
01:33:34,026 --> 01:33:35,444
Enough.

894
01:33:38,531 --> 01:33:40,741
I shall talk with you alone.

895
01:34:33,752 --> 01:34:37,298
She has renounced her claim
on the Son of Adam's blood.

896
01:34:38,716 --> 01:34:41,468
How do I know
your promise will be kept?

897
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,190
Susan!

898
01:36:27,241 --> 01:36:29,535
Shouldn't you both be in bed?

899
01:36:32,746 --> 01:36:34,540
We couldn't sleep.

900
01:36:36,083 --> 01:36:37,710
Please, Aslan.

901
01:36:39,003 --> 01:36:40,713
Couldn't we come with you?

902
01:36:40,796 --> 01:36:43,716
I would be glad
of the company for a while.

903
01:36:45,509 --> 01:36:47,011
Thank you.

904
01:37:11,410 --> 01:37:13,203
It is time.

905
01:37:13,287 --> 01:37:16,415
From here, I must go on alone.

906
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:17,541
But Aslan...

907
01:37:17,624 --> 01:37:21,170
You have to trust me.
For this must be done.

908
01:37:22,129 --> 01:37:23,922
Thank you, Susan.

909
01:37:24,381 --> 01:37:26,050
Thank you, Lucy.

910
01:37:26,467 --> 01:37:27,968
And farewell.

911
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:37,413
Behold. The great lion.

912
01:39:03,439 --> 01:39:05,357
Do you want some milk?

913
01:39:06,942 --> 01:39:09,027
Why doesn't he fight back?

914
01:39:10,195 --> 01:39:11,530
Bind him!

915
01:39:13,282 --> 01:39:15,367
Tie him up! Get him!

916
01:39:21,665 --> 01:39:22,791
Wait!

917
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:26,086
Let him first be shaved.

918
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,068
Bring him to me.

919
01:40:51,296 --> 01:40:52,965
You know, Aslan,

920
01:40:53,966 --> 01:40:56,426
I'm a little disappointed in you.

921
01:40:58,178 --> 01:41:02,766
Did you honestly think by all this
that you could save the human traitor?

922
01:41:05,394 --> 01:41:07,896
You are giving me your life

923
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:10,315
and saving no one.

924
01:41:13,110 --> 01:41:15,153
So much for love.

925
01:41:23,579 --> 01:41:25,038
Tonight,

926
01:41:26,873 --> 01:41:31,503
the Deep Magic will be appeased!

927
01:41:34,923 --> 01:41:36,508
But tomorrow,

928
01:41:39,052 --> 01:41:41,930
we will take Narnia

929
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:45,475
forever!

930
01:41:52,107 --> 01:41:53,817
In that knowledge,

931
01:41:54,901 --> 01:41:56,361
despair

932
01:42:06,538 --> 01:42:08,624
and die!

933
01:42:27,601 --> 01:42:29,561
The Great Cat

934
01:42:29,645 --> 01:42:31,396
is dead!

935
01:42:35,734 --> 01:42:37,027
General.

936
01:42:37,653 --> 01:42:40,072
Prepare your troops for battle.

937
01:42:43,992 --> 01:42:46,078
However short it may be.

938
01:43:34,334 --> 01:43:35,877
It's too late.

939
01:43:37,671 --> 01:43:39,089
He's gone.

940
01:43:58,859 --> 01:44:01,653
He must have known
what he was doing.

941
01:44:35,103 --> 01:44:38,023
Get away! Get away, all of you!

942
01:44:38,857 --> 01:44:41,485
No. Look.

943
01:45:02,714 --> 01:45:04,841
We have to tell the others.

944
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:08,970
- We can't just leave him!
- Lucy, there's no time.

945
01:45:09,554 --> 01:45:11,264
They need to know.

946
01:45:18,063 --> 01:45:19,481
The trees.

947
01:46:04,234 --> 01:46:06,069
Be still, my Princes.

948
01:46:07,863 --> 01:46:10,657
I bring grave news from your sisters.

949
01:46:26,464 --> 01:46:28,091
She's right.

950
01:46:31,386 --> 01:46:32,971
He's gone.

951
01:46:38,977 --> 01:46:41,146
Then you'll have to lead us.

952
01:46:43,023 --> 01:46:47,986
Peter, there's an army out there
and it's ready to follow you.

953
01:46:48,361 --> 01:46:51,031
- I can't.
- Aslan believed you could.

954
01:46:54,910 --> 01:46:56,494
And so do I.

955
01:47:04,085 --> 01:47:08,048
The Witch's army is nearing, sire.
What are your orders?

956
01:47:53,969 --> 01:47:55,220
They come, Your Highness,

957
01:47:55,303 --> 01:47:57,681
in numbers and weapons
far greater than our own.

958
01:47:57,764 --> 01:47:59,683
Numbers do not win a battle.

959
01:47:59,766 --> 01:48:03,144
No. But I bet they help.

960
01:49:33,735 --> 01:49:36,362
I have no interest in prisoners.

961
01:49:36,446 --> 01:49:37,989
Kill them all.

962
01:50:27,747 --> 01:50:29,207
Go on!

963
01:50:35,463 --> 01:50:37,507
Look to the sky!

964
01:51:05,118 --> 01:51:06,744
Are you with me?

965
01:51:08,204 --> 01:51:09,664
To the death.

966
01:51:12,917 --> 01:51:17,338
For Narnia and for Aslan!

967
01:51:21,092 --> 01:51:22,760
Go!

968
01:51:24,137 --> 01:51:27,140
Go! For Aslan!

969
01:52:58,898 --> 01:53:00,441
We should go.

970
01:53:05,989 --> 01:53:07,824
I'm so cold.

971
01:53:34,350 --> 01:53:35,560
Susan!

972
01:53:52,410 --> 01:53:54,037
Where's Aslan?

973
01:53:55,580 --> 01:53:57,457
What have they done?

974
01:54:07,550 --> 01:54:09,135
Aslan!

975
01:54:17,685 --> 01:54:19,771
But we saw the knife. The Witch.

976
01:54:19,854 --> 01:54:23,107
If the Witch knew
the true meaning of sacrifice,

977
01:54:23,608 --> 01:54:26,819
she might have interpreted
the Deep Magic differently.

978
01:54:26,903 --> 01:54:29,781
That when a willing victim
who has committed no treachery

979
01:54:29,864 --> 01:54:32,200
is killed in a traitor's stead,

980
01:54:32,283 --> 01:54:34,369
the Stone Table will crack

981
01:54:35,495 --> 01:54:38,373
and even death itself
will turn backwards.

982
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:41,667
We sent the news that you were dead.

983
01:54:41,751 --> 01:54:43,836
Peter and Edmund
will have gone to war.

984
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:45,421
We have to help them.

985
01:54:45,505 --> 01:54:48,466
We will, dear one, but not alone.

986
01:54:49,634 --> 01:54:51,219
Climb on my back.

987
01:54:51,302 --> 01:54:54,389
We have far to go
and little time to get there.

988
01:54:54,472 --> 01:54:57,225
And you may want to cover your ears.

989
01:55:17,745 --> 01:55:19,205
Fire!

990
01:55:39,517 --> 01:55:40,643
Yes!

991
01:55:53,531 --> 01:55:56,451
Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!

992
01:55:57,702 --> 01:56:00,163
That's the signal. Come on!

993
01:56:08,254 --> 01:56:10,047
Where are we going?

994
01:56:19,891 --> 01:56:21,184
Hang on!

995
01:56:22,810 --> 01:56:24,312
Fall back!

996
01:56:26,105 --> 01:56:27,773
Go on, fall back!

997
01:57:04,227 --> 01:57:05,645
Stop!

998
01:59:18,194 --> 01:59:20,905
- Susan, this is...
- Mr Tumnus!

999
01:59:23,074 --> 01:59:26,452
Come, we must hurry
and search the castle.

1000
01:59:26,535 --> 01:59:28,746
Peter will need everyone we can find.

1001
01:59:55,815 --> 01:59:58,609
Edmund! There's too many!

1002
01:59:58,693 --> 02:00:00,111
Get out of here!

1003
02:00:00,194 --> 02:00:02,780
Get the girls and get them home!

1004
02:00:05,574 --> 02:00:07,743
You heard him! Let's go!

1005
02:00:27,763 --> 02:00:29,306
Peter said get out of here!

1006
02:00:29,390 --> 02:00:31,225
Peter's not king yet.

1007
02:02:08,239 --> 02:02:09,615
Impossible!

1008
02:03:24,315 --> 02:03:25,900
It is finished.

1009
02:03:27,234 --> 02:03:28,819
- Peter!
- Peter!

1010
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:36,827
Where's Edmund?

1011
02:03:48,547 --> 02:03:49,882
Edmund!

1012
02:04:43,268 --> 02:04:46,397
When are you gonna learn
to do as you're told?

1013
02:06:21,283 --> 02:06:24,244
To the glistening Eastern Sea,

1014
02:06:24,328 --> 02:06:27,956
I give you Queen Lucy, the Valiant.

1015
02:06:53,524 --> 02:06:55,692
To the great Western Wood,

1016
02:06:56,068 --> 02:06:59,363
King Edmund, the Just.

1017
02:07:01,532 --> 02:07:03,742
To the radiant Southern Sun,

1018
02:07:05,702 --> 02:07:08,539
Queen Susan, the Gentle.

1019
02:07:10,249 --> 02:07:13,335
And to the clear Northern Sky,

1020
02:07:13,752 --> 02:07:16,046
I give you King Peter,

1021
02:07:17,297 --> 02:07:18,966
the Magnificent.

1022
02:07:23,303 --> 02:07:26,056
Once a King or Queen of Narnia,

1023
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:28,350
always a King or Queen.

1024
02:07:29,434 --> 02:07:30,853
May your wisdom grace us

1025
02:07:30,936 --> 02:07:33,981
until the stars rain down
from the heavens.

1026
02:07:34,773 --> 02:07:37,025
Long live King Peter!

1027
02:07:37,109 --> 02:07:39,236
Long live King Edmund!

1028
02:07:39,862 --> 02:07:42,114
Long live Queen Susan!

1029
02:07:42,197 --> 02:07:45,242
Long live Queen Lucy!

1030
02:08:09,892 --> 02:08:11,393
Don't worry.

1031
02:08:13,729 --> 02:08:15,355
We'll see him again.

1032
02:08:15,439 --> 02:08:17,566
- When?
- In time.

1033
02:08:19,359 --> 02:08:23,488
One day he'll be here
and the next he won't.

1034
02:08:25,741 --> 02:08:27,951
But you mustn't press him.

1035
02:08:28,535 --> 02:08:31,079
After all, he's not a tame lion.

1036
02:08:32,289 --> 02:08:33,415
No.

1037
02:08:34,917 --> 02:08:36,543
But he is good.

1038
02:08:37,211 --> 02:08:38,503
Here.

1039
02:08:40,464 --> 02:08:42,466
You need it more than I do.

1040
02:09:38,522 --> 02:09:40,565
Are you all right, Philip?

1041
02:09:40,649 --> 02:09:42,943
I'm not as young as I once was.

1042
02:09:45,570 --> 02:09:47,030
Come on, Ed.

1043
02:09:47,990 --> 02:09:50,742
- Catching my breath.
- That's all we'll catch at this rate.

1044
02:09:50,826 --> 02:09:53,287
- What did he say, Susan?
- "Wait in the castle.

1045
02:09:53,370 --> 02:09:55,455
"I'll get the stag myself."

1046
02:10:00,919 --> 02:10:02,379
What's this?

1047
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:10,053
It seems familiar.

1048
02:10:13,098 --> 02:10:14,975
As if from a dream.

1049
02:10:15,058 --> 02:10:16,977
Or a dream of a dream.

1050
02:10:20,397 --> 02:10:22,024
Spare Oom.

1051
02:10:25,569 --> 02:10:27,321
- Lucy!
- Not again.

1052
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:31,491
- Lu?
- Come on!

1053
02:10:43,420 --> 02:10:45,422
These aren't branches.

1054
02:10:47,299 --> 02:10:50,510
- They're coats.
- Susan, you're on my foot!

1055
02:10:50,594 --> 02:10:52,637
Peter, move off!

1056
02:10:52,763 --> 02:10:54,514
- Stop shoving.
- Stop it!

1057
02:10:54,598 --> 02:10:56,433
I'm not on your toe!

1058
02:11:14,826 --> 02:11:16,453
There you are.

1059
02:11:18,789 --> 02:11:21,583
What were you all
doing in the wardrobe?

1060
02:11:23,293 --> 02:11:26,338
You wouldn't believe us
if we told you, sir.

1061
02:11:32,052 --> 02:11:33,303
Try me.

1062
02:12:36,491 --> 02:12:39,661
I don't think you'll get back in that way.

1063
02:12:42,414 --> 02:12:45,459
You see, I've already tried.

1064
02:12:49,212 --> 02:12:51,006
Will we ever go back?

1065
02:12:51,089 --> 02:12:52,799
Oh, I expect so.

1066
02:12:54,050 --> 02:12:57,721
But it'll probably happen
when you're not looking for it.

1067
02:12:59,473 --> 02:13:01,099
All the same,

1068
02:13:01,183 --> 02:13:03,518
best to keep your eyes open.
